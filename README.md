# First ML Project: Predicting Molecular Solubility

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow to predict molecular solubility (`logS`) using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. It uses a dataset with molecular descriptors and compares the performance of both models.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Delaney solubility dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv) and contains molecular descriptors along with solubility values (`logS`).  

- **Features (X):** Molecular descriptors  
- **Target (Y):** `logS` (log solubility)
